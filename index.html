           <p> If this is your first choice, then I am the happier man alive right now. But of course I will never know what your choice was.<br>
            The only way I can figure it out is when I start seeing you puting more effort in our relationship, when I can clearly see without a single doubt that I am the one you were waiting for after being single for so long.<br>
            If this wasn't your first choice then you probably read what was in the second option. <br>
            I enjoyed making this, I enjoyed being at work and thinking about how to fix bugs, or how to adjust color, fonts etc and hopefully you liked reading it too.
